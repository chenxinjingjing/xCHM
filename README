 xCHM - the CHM viewer for UNIX
 (c) 2003 - 2013 Razvan Cojocaru <rzvncj@gmail.com>

 
 * Prerequisites

 In order to be able to compile the code you need to have wxWidgets and
 CHMLIB installed. You can get wxWidgets from:

 http://www.wxwidgets.org

 Get the GTK+ version (also known as wxGTK). xCHM currently compiles
 with all flavours of wxWidgets, but only works well and looks truly
 appealing with wxGTK, so I recommend against bothering to use it with
 anything else.

 You can get CHMLIB from:

 http://www.jedrea.com/chmlib/

 After you've installed the above you're ready for the next phase.


 * Installing

 Type ./configure --help if you're interested in parameters you can pass
 to configure for compile switches. Most people will be perfectly happy
 doing a:

 ./configure && make

 Once everything is built, type

 make install

 and the executable should be somewhere in your $PATH (hopefully :)).
 Now you can just type

 xchm

 and start your session.

 
 * Generating documentation

 If you'd like to generate developer documentation go to the root
 of the distribution and type

 doxygen

 This of course implies that you have doxygen installed. The documentation
 will be generated in the doc directory in HTML and LaTex format. The doc
 directory will be created in the process of creating the documentation so
 it's ok that it's not present by default in the tarball.
 Alternatively, you can just download the already generated docs from the
 Sourceforge project page.


 * Legal stuff

 As far as I know this is legal code. If you know that the code is in any 
 way illegal in your country, please drop me a note and stop using it / do 
 not install it.


 * Contact

 For bug reports and patches, please use the address above.
 For everything else, count to 10 and if you still want to send the
 message, go ahead. Can't promise I'll answer everything though.


 * Happy reading!
